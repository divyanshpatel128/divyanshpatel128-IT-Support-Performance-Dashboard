- **Medium Priority**: ~72 hrs  
- **Low Priority**: ~96 hrs  

**6. Which types of tickets take the longest to close?**

- 🇸🇪 Sweden

### D. Process Improvement

**9. Can we group similar tickets to create automated replies or help articles?**  
✔ Yes. Tags like **“Login”**, **“Bug”**, and **“Security”** are repetitive.  
👉 Recommend setting up **FAQs, Chatbots, and Auto-Replies**

**10. Are the agent responses helpful and aligned with what the user asked?**  
✔ Based on tag alignment and resolution tags, yes in most cases — but some “Documentation” and “Crash” issues indicate potential mismatches.

**11. Where can the support team save time or improve service quality?**  
✔ Focus on:
- Departments like **Customer Operations** (high ticket count + long resolution)  
- Repetitive issue types  
- Seasonal peak months (**April, July, August**)
